# `Markdown`
SKH 20181231

## What is it?

[`Markdown`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a way to format text using plain text syntax.  
This [`README.md`](README.md) is written in `Markdown`.
To see the plain text version of this page, click [`HERE`](README.md).

`Markdown`, or a slight variation, is used in [`jupyter notebook`](../jupyter_notebook/README.md), `slack`, and `RStudio`.

## How do you use it?

[`Markdown tutorial`](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

### Basic usage

* surround text with `*` to *italize*  
* surround text with `**` to **bold**
* Create headings with `#`. The more `#`s the smaller the text
* Create bulleted lists by starting a line with `*` and a space.

Once again, click [`HERE`](README.md) to examples of all the formatting above. 

## Tips and Tricks

I use the [`atom`](../atom/README.md) extension "Markdown Preview Plus" to take notes.

I use [`pandoc`](../pandoc/README.md) to convert my `markdown` files to `pdf`s.
