## What is it?

[`atom`](https://atom.io/) is a "hackable" text editor.
"Hackable" means you can install packages made by the broader community to add functionality to the `atom` base.

I use atom to write code (which I then run via the terminal) and to write notes in `Markdown`.

## How do I use it?

Out of the box ([`atom.io`]((https://atom.io/))), `atom` is ready to use as a GUI text editor.
