SKH 20181231

## What is it?

[`Github`](https://github.com/) is the web-based GUI (graphical user interface) for the version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

[The `Git` parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html) explains the reasoning behind version control.

## How do you use it?

Most of the time, you will only need to use four `git` commands: add, commit, push, and pull.

### Retrieve changes

To get changes from `Github` to your local copy: `git pull`

### Add changes

To push changes from your local copy to `Github`:
1. `git add <file>` or `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "short, clear message"`
3. `git push`

## Tips and Tricks

* Each project/paper should have its own `Github` repo.   

## Oh no! I broke my repo...
